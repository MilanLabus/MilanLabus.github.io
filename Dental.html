                <h2>Wisdom Tooth Extraction</h2>
                <p>Many people require removal of their wisdom teeth, as there is not enough room in the jaws to allow them to come through normally.
                    When this is the case, the teeth sometimes start to come through the gum on their sides,
                     and hence some of the tooth is visible poking through the gum casuing pain and infections.

                <h2>Dental Cysts</h2>
                <p>Cysts are fluid filled cavities that can sometimes develop in the jaws. They can be present for many years in some cases before ever being noticed or found. 
                    They tend to stay dormant in the jaws for many years and very often are noticed coincidentally on an x-ray, 
                    when a dentist may be looking at other teeth in that area.</p>

                <h2>Dental Implants</h2>
                <p>Consider dental implants to be a permanent root replacement for a lost tooth. Implants are typically made from titanium, which is a material that offers a number of benefits including its inability to resist corrosion.
                    The tooth implant will need to be surgically placed into the jaw. </p>

                <h2>Tooth Exposures</h2>
                <p>Some adult teeth remain buried in the gum and do not erupt along with other teeth into the proper position.
                     It can look like that these teeth are missing as they are not visible in the mouth. We use an x-ray to discover this.</p>
